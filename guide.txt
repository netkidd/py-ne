git branch experiment_1


git branch


# To work in a different branch

git checkout experiment_1


# We can do commits and push the branch as with the master


# If at some point we want to merge the experiment_1 branch into the master branch

1) move to master branch
git checkout master

2) Merge
git merge experiment_1
